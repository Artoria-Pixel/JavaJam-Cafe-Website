        <p>The JavaJam website uses hierarchical site organization. This is the most appropriate as the site has only four pages. Using hierarchical organization allows for easy navagation and 
        categorization of content.</p>
        <p>Three design practices that have been well implemented for this site:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Consistent site header/logo.</li>
            <li>Good contrast between text and background.</li>
            <li>Color is used consistently.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Three design practices that could be implemented in a better way:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Slightly larger footer text for better visibility.</li>
            <li>More graphics depicting JavaJam products.</li>
            <li>Use of a more appealing color scheme.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        How else would you improve the website?
        <ul>
            <li>I would add more images of JavaJam products on the menu page.</li>
            <li>I would have a link to the musician&#39;s website or contact information on the music page.</li>
            <li>I would add song clips or a track list to the music page.</li>
        </ul>
